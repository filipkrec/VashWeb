                  <div>VashWEB is a site about internet freedom and self expression.
                     It's a sort of an online spin on bilboards.<br/>
                     Post adds,wish someone a happy birthday,promote yourself,
                     show off your work,post a funny meme or
                     just antagonise everyone with an insanely stupid post
                     which takes up space and time.
                     All you have to do is wait in a queue for a while,
                     because everyone gets to take a turn.
                      Feel free to post anything you like.</div>
